          quantities;
          however they are hard to obtain. Due to the <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-new-york-fashion-week-take-place-september-limited-or-no-spectatorsrestrictions"> restrictions placed on New York Fashion Week
            this year by
            Governor Andrew Cuomo,</a> the event became more accessible to the public. </p>

            <p> Normally fashion shows are exclusive to those in the industry. However, as a result of COVID-19, they have become more democratic in a sense. This year the public had access to the shows at the same time as the industry
              professionals.
